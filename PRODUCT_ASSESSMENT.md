3. **Universal Financial Operations**
   - All businesses need: revenue forecasting, expense management, cash flow
   - All businesses need: budgets, variance analysis, reporting

4. **No Deep Vertical Integration**
   - Missing industry-specific features like:
     - **Healthcare**: Patient billing, insurance claims, HIPAA workflows
     - **Retail**: Inventory management, POS integration, SKU tracking
     - **Manufacturing**: Production planning, supply chain, BOM
